		<German>The Browning Hi-Power is a single-action, 9mm semi-automatic handgun. It is based on a design by American firearms inventor John Browning, and later improved by Dieudonné Saive at Fabrique Nationale (FN) of Herstal, Belgium. Browning died in 1926, several years before the design was finalized. The Hi-Power is one of the most widely used military pistols of all time, having been used by the armed forces of over 50 countries. The Hi-Power name alluded to the 13-round magazine capacity; almost twice that of contemporary designs such as the Luger or Mauser 1910. The pistol is often referred to as an HP (for "Hi-Power" or "High-Power") or as a GP (for the French term, "Grande Puissance"). The term P-35  is also used, based on the introduction of the pistol in 1935. It is most often called the "Hi-Power", even in Belgium. It is also known as the BAP (Browning Automatic Pistol), particularly in Irish service. In the Canadian Forces it is generally called a "nine mil", or, by French Canadian troops, a "neuf millimètres". Technically, the High Power pistol, also known as Browning HP 35, GP 35 or Model 1935, is a recoil operated, locked breech pistol. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>Heckler + Koch started the development of a new Universal Selbstlade Pistole (Universal Self-loading Pistol, or USP in short), in the mid-1989. The concept of the new design was to provide a universal weapon for police and military forces, available in a variety of versions and sizes. The target market for this new weapon was apparently the USA, as the first version of the pistol, which appeared in 1993, was chambered for a new American cartridge, the .40 S+W. A 9mm version appeared a little later, and in 1995 the slightly modified 9mm USP pistol was adopted by the  Bundeswehr (German army) as its new service pistol, under the designation P8. The same year the company also brought out another 'America-special' version of the USP, this time in.45 ACP caliber. There are several special-purpose versions of the USP, which includes two original variations fitted with extended threaded barrels to be used with silencers--the .45 caliber USP Tactical, 9mm USP 9 SD, and the .45 caliber USP 45 Compact Tactical--which are sometimes preferred by the US Military over the Mark 23 Model 0. USP pistols are short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistols with a polymer frame. Barrels on all USP pistols have polygonal rifling, except the earliest production pistols made in 1993, and all German army P8’s. The trigger is double-action, with an external hammer, an automatic firing pin safety and a frame-mounted lever. Each pistol can be easily adjusted by a gunsmith to any of the trigger mode configurations, with the replacement of a few parts that include a cam plate and a safety lever. The sights are dovetailed to the slide. Magazines on most USP pistols are of steel construction, but Bundeswehr-owned P8 pistols have semi-translucent polymer magazines. Magazine release levers are ambidextrous and located at the base of the trigger-guard. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

The sights are dovetailed to the slide. Magazines on most USP pistols are of steel construction, but Bundeswehr-owned P8 pistols have semi-translucent polymer magazines.

		<Czech>Heckler + Koch started the development of a new Universal Selbstlade Pistole (Universal Self-loading Pistol, or USP in short), in the mid-1989. The concept of the new design was to provide a universal weapon for police and military forces, available in a variety of versions and sizes. The target market for this new weapon was apparently the USA, as the first version of the pistol, which appeared in 1993, was chambered for a new American cartridge, the .40 S+W. A 9mm version appeared a little later, and in 1995 the slightly modified 9mm USP pistol was adopted by the  Bundeswehr (German army) as its new service pistol, under the designation P8. The same year the company also brought out another 'America-special' version of the USP, this time in.45 ACP caliber. There are several special-purpose versions of the USP, which includes two original variations fitted with extended threaded barrels to be used with silencers--the .45 caliber USP Tactical, 9mm USP 9 SD, and the .45 caliber USP 45 Compact Tactical--which are sometimes preferred by the US Military over the Mark 23 Model 0. USP pistols are short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistols with a polymer frame. Barrels on all USP pistols have polygonal rifling, except the earliest production pistols made in 1993, and all German army P8’s.

		<German>During the early- to mid-1950s West Germany faced the need for rearming its army for the newest common 7.62x51mm NATO caliber small arms. Initially Germans preferred the Belgian FN FAL rifle, and adopted it circa 1956 under the designation of G1. Due to obvious reasons Germany wanted to manufacture its military rifles, and attempted to buy a manufacturing license for FAL, but Belgium rejected the deal. Instead, Germany bought the manufacturing license for the Spanish CETME rifle and transferred it to the Heckler und Koch (HK) company, located in Oberndorf. HK slightly modified the CETME design, and in 1959 the Bundeswehr finally adopted the CETME/Heckler-Koch rifle as G3 (Gewehr 3 - Rifle, [model] 3). A total of more than 50 countries during the last 40 years have issued the G3 to its forces. The key reason for its high popularity is that it is much simpler and cheaper to manufacture than its major contemporary rivals. HK still manufactures a wide variety of firearms based on the G3 design but of different purposes and calibers, like MP-5 and 5.56mm HK33. The G3 rifle is a selective fire, magazine fed rifle, built using delayed blowback action, developed by German engineers at Mauser Werke late in the 2nd World War and refined in Spain, at the CETME company. In the mid-1960s the initial design was upgraded to the G3A3 and G3A4 configurations. These rifles had ventilated plastic handguards and a drum-type rear diopter sights, marked from 100 to 400 meters. Late German production G3A3 and G3A4 models were built using new trigger units, integral with restyled pistol grip and triggerguard, made from plastic. Every G3 rifle can be equipped with detachable bipods, claw-type detachable scope mounts. Long-barreled versions can be fitted with bayonet or used to launch rifle grenades from the barrel. Folding cocking handle is located on the special tube above the barrel, at the left side, and does not reciprocate when gun is fired. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The M60 is a family of American general purpose machine guns firing 7.62x51mm NATO cartridges from a disintegrating belt of M13 links. Introduced in 1957, it has served with every branch of the U.S. military and the initial version was officially adopted by the U.S. Army in the late 1950s. During tests the M60 was fairly effective, but in the jungles of Southeast Asia displayed several potent shortcomings. For units in Vietnam, the single most common complaint was that the M60 was comparatively unreliable and prone to jamming and other malfunctions, especially when it was dirty. Fine sand and dust in the mechanism could bring the M60 to a halt. This was a major factor in the Israeli Defense Force declining to adopt the M60. In normal conditions it would often fire thousands of rounds without a serious jam while field conditions tended to reduce reliability without proper maintenance. The safety was awkward to operate and worked the 'wrong way' for soldiers who were trained with the M16 rifle and M1911A1 pistol in that it required an upward movement of the thumb on the safety catch to make the gun ready to fire rather than a downward movement as with the other weapons. Additionally, it was possible to install parts of the fire control mechanism incorrectly, causing a "runaway gun" where it would keep firing until empty, even if the operator took his finger off the trigger. Several critical parts of early production M60s, such as the receiver cover and feed tray, were made from very thin sheet metal stampings and prone to bending or breaking. The U.S. Marines especially disliked the M60, and many Marine units held onto their BARs until 1967–68 officially, and longer unofficially. The reliability problem with the M60 machine gun was even more evident when the gun was compared to the successful and reliable PK machine gun used by Warsaw Pact forces and Soviet client states. &lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia</German>

		<German>The M60E3 was fielded circa 1986 in an attempt to remedy problems with earlier versions of the M60 for infantry use. It is a lightweight, 'improved' version intended to reduce the load carried by the gunner. Unlike its predecessors, the M60E3 has several updated modern features. It has a bipod (attached to the receiver) for improved stability, ambidextrous safety, universal sling attachments, a carrying handle on the barrel, and a simplified gas system. However, these features also caused almost as many problems for the weapon as they fixed. There were different types of barrels used, but the lightweight barrel was not as safe for sustained fire at 200 rounds per minute as heavier types. The reduced-weight components also reduced the durability of the weapon, making it more prone to rapid wear and parts breakage than the original. Most infantry units in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have now switched over to the M240 as their general-purpose machine gun, which is more reliable (particularly when dirty) and seems to be well-liked by the troops for its ruggedness, despite the fact it weighs an extra two kilograms. &lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia</German>

Most infantry units in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have now switched over to the M240 as their general-purpose machine gun, which is more reliable (particularly when dirty) and seems to be well-liked by the troops for its ruggedness, despite the fact it weighs an extra two kilograms. &lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia</Italian>

		<German>The SR-25 (Stoner Rifle-25) is a semi-automatic sniper rifle designed by Eugene Stoner and manufactured by Knight's Armament Company. The SR-25 uses a rotating bolt and a direct impingement gas system. It is loosely based on Stoner's AR-10, rebuilt in its original 7.62x51mm NATO caliber. Up to 60% of parts of the SR-25 are interchangeable with the AR-15 and M16—everything but the receiver, the hammer, the barrel assembly and the carrier/bolt. SR-25 barrels were originally manufactured by Remington Arms with its 5R (5 grooves, rounded) rifling, with twist 1:11.25 (1 turn in 11.25 inches / 286 millimetres). The heavy 20 in (510 mm) barrel is free-floating, so handguards are attached to the front of the receiver and do not touch the barrel. The SR-25 enhanced match rifle utilizes the newer URX II Picatinny-Weaver rail system. The match version is designed to shoot at a precision of 0.5 minute of arc, which corresponds to 0.5-inch (13 mm) groups at 100 yards (91 m). The Mk 11 Mod 0 system comes in 7.62 mm NATO caliber, and is designed for match-grade 7.62x51mm NATO ammunition. The Mk 11 system includes the rifle, 20 round box magazines, QD (Quick Detachable) scope rings, Leupold Vari-X Mil-dot riflescope, Harris swivel-base bipod on a Knight's mount, and QD sound suppressor, which is also manufactured by Knight's Armament Co. Flip-up BUIS (Back up iron sights) are attached to the modified gas block and upper receiver. The Mk 11 Mod 0 utilizes a Obermeyer 20 in (510 mm) match target barrel, along with a RAS (Rail Accessory System) fore-end made by KAC, consisting of an 11.35 in (288 mm) long match fore-end. The RAS allows for quick attachment/detachment of MIL-STD-1913 components. The aluminium fore-end makes no contact with the barrel forward of the receiver, allowing for extreme accuracy. The Mk 11 Mod 0 has an empty weight of 15.3 lb (6.9 kg), and an overall length of 45.4 in (115 cm). &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (or M110 SASS) is a semi-automatic rifle that is chambered for the 7.62x51mm NATO round, developed by the American firearm manufacturer Knight's Armament Company and based on their SR-25 rifle. Concluding trials in 2005, it was selected as the US Army's Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle (XM110 SASR) winner, intended to replace the M24 SWS (Sniper Weapon System). The rifle is similar to the SR-25/Mk 11 Mod 0  semi-automatic precision rifles, but differs significantly in buttstock and rail system design. The SR-25, Mk 11 Mod 0, and M110 are based loosely off the original AR-10 developed by Eugene Stoner  but feature additional refinements instituted by KAC to maximize parts commonality with the AR15/M16, improve weapon reliability, and increase accuracy. There was some controversy this choice, as some experts doubted that Knight's semi-automatic XM110 rifle could equal long-range accuracy of the bolt-action M24. However, troops have rated the weapon extremely highly, noting the quality of the weapon and its semi-automatic capabilities compared to the bolt-action M24. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The United States Marines wanted an accurate sniper rifle during the Vietnam War. The M14 was selected because of its accuracy, reliability, and the ability for a quick second shot. As a result, in 1969, the Rock Island Arsenal converted 1,435 National Match (target grade) M14s by adding a Leatherwood 3–9x Adjustable Ranging Telescope and providing National Match grade ammunition. It was designated the M21 in 1975. The M21 remained the Army's primary sniper rifle until 1988, when it was replaced by the M24 Sniper Weapon System. In standard military use, the M21 uses a 20-round box magazine as the other members of the M14 family, and weighs 11.6 pounds (5.27 kg) without the scope. The U.S. military never officially authorized or purchased magazines in any other capacity, although 5- and 10-round magazines are available. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The MG 3 is a German general purpose machine gun chambered for the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge. The weapon's design is derived from the World War II era MG 42 universal machine gun that fired the 7.92x57mm Mauser round. The MG 3 was developed in the late 1950s and adopted into service with the newly formed Bundeswehr, where it continues to serve to this day as a squad support weapon and vehicle-mounted machine gun. The weapon and its derivatives have also been acquired by the armed forces of over 30 countries. Production rights to the machine gun were purchased by Italy, Spain (MG 42/59), Pakistan (MG 1A3), Greece, Iran, Sudan and Turkey. he MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. The MG 3 is still used as the standard secondary weapon of most modern German armoured fighting vehicle designs (e.g. Leopard 2, PzH 2000, Marder), as a primary weapon on light/non-armored vehicles (e.g. LKW 2to, ATF Dingo) and as an infantry weapon on light bipods as well as different tripods.

The MG 3 was developed in the late 1950s and adopted into service with the newly formed Bundeswehr, where it continues to serve to this day as a squad support weapon and vehicle-mounted machine gun. The weapon and its derivatives have also been acquired by the armed forces of over 30 countries. Production rights to the machine gun were purchased by Italy, Spain (MG 42/59), Pakistan (MG 1A3), Greece, Iran, Sudan and Turkey. he MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. The MG 3 is still used as the standard secondary weapon of most modern German armoured fighting vehicle designs (e.g. Leopard 2, PzH 2000, Marder), as a primary weapon on light/non-armored vehicles (e.g. LKW 2to, ATF Dingo) and as an infantry weapon on light bipods as well as different tripods. However, the German Armed Forces will phase out the MG 3 in 2012 and will introduce a replacement in 2011. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</French>

		<German>The SG 540 is a 5.56mm assault rifle developed in the early 1970s by Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG, currently SAN Swiss Arms AG) as a potential replacement for the 7.5mm SG 510 automatic rifle. Work on a new generation of lightweight rifle using the intermediate 5.56mm round began at SIG in the 1960s and resulted in the somewhat unsuccessful SG 530-1 design that employed a gas-assisted roller-delayed blowback  operating mechanism which proved too complicated and expensive to manufacture. As a result, in 1969 SIG chose to dispense with the complex roller-delayed action opting instead for a design using the more robust and simple piston-operated rotating bolt locking mechanism (derived from the Soviet 7.62mm AK  assault rifle). This combination was to be successful and the rifle entered production as a family of weapons consisting of the base 5.56mm SG 540, the 7.62mm SG 542 and the 5.56mm SG 543 carbine, where both 5.56mm weapons were designed for use with 5.56x45mm NATO M193 ammunition and the SG 542 with the full size 7.62x51mm NATO rifle cartridge. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) is a family of infantry arms consisting of an assault rifle, a light machine gun and a carbine. It is manufactured by the Indian State Ordnance Factory Board at its Ishapore factory. The Insas Assault Rifle is now the standard infantry weapon of the Indian Armed Forces. The Indian armed forces had been equipped with a copy of the FN FAL rifle since the 1950s. With the FAL becoming obsolete in the 1980s, India began to develop the INSAS, incorporating features from several contemporary rifle designs. The INSAS system was originally planned to have three component weapons: a standard rifle, a carbine, and a squad automatic rifle (LMG), all chambered for 5.56x45mm NATO  ammunition. In 1997 the rifle and LMG were ready for mass production, and served during the Kargil War and Nepalese Civil War. The mass introduction of the INSAS rifle was initially delayed by the lack of domestically made 5.56 mm ammunition; India accordingly bought significant stocks from the Israeli company, IMI. The INSAS rifle is based on the famous Kalashnikov AK-47 action, but with many modifications. The basic gas-operated action is of the Kalashnikov pattern. The gas system is fitted with a manual gas regulator similar in design to that found on the FN FAL as well as a gas cutoff. The charging handle is positioned on the left side of the forearm; it is similar in position and design to the German HK G3 rifle. According to the Times of India, the rifle encountered some reliability problems in the very cold climate of the 1999 Kargil conflict with Pakistan; the cold weather caused the rifle to jam occasionally and the polymer magazines would crack. According to the manufacturers, these problems have been fixed. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The HK33 is a 5.56mm assault rifle developed in the 1960s by West German armament manufacturer Heckler + Koch GmbH (H+K), primarily for export. Capitalizing on the success of their G3  design, the company developed a family of small arms (all using the G3 operating principle and basic design concept) consisting of four types of firearms: the first type, chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, the second—using the Soviet 7.62x39mm M43 round, third—the intermediate 5.56x45mm caliber and the fourth type—chambered for the 9x19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. The HK33 series of rifles were adopted by the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira or FAB), the armed forces of Thailand and Malaysia where they were produced under a license agreement.

		<German>Following the revision of the OICW Block 1/XM8 program, the Heckler and Koch company decided to enter the US military and law enforcement markets with an alternative design. Based on the experience, gained during successful upgrade program of the British SA80 / L85A1 program, HK decided to cure the existing M16 rifles and  M4 carbines from most of their problems, inherent to this 40-years old design. The key improvements, made by HK, are their patented short-stroke gas piston system, borrowed from HK G36 rifle. This system replaced the direct gas system of standard M16 rifle, so no powder residue will remain in the receiver even after long shooting sessions. Other improvements include new buffer assembly, improved bolt, and a cold hammer forged barrel, as well as free-floating handguard with integral Picatinny-type rails. Originally developed as a "drop-in" upper receiver assembly for any standard M16/M4 type lower receiver, HK416 is also available as a complete weapon, with HK-made lower receivers. &lt;br/&gt;The HK416 is a gas operated, selective fired weapon of modular design. It uses short-stroke gas piston that operates the 7-lug rotating bolt. Receiver is made from high grade aluminium alloy. Combination-type safety/fire selector allows for single shots and full automatic mode. Hk416 retains all M16-style controls, including last round bolt hold-open device, rear-based charging handle and magazine release button on the right side of the magazine well. HK416 is fitted with four Picatinny rails as standard, and may accept any type of sighting devices on STANAG-1913 compliant mounts. It also can accept modified HK AG36/AG-C 40mm grenade launcher, which is clamped directly to bottom rail. Buttstock is of typical M4 design, multi-position telescoped. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

		<German>The Galil is a family of Israeli small arms designed by Yisrael Galili and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s and produced by Israel Military Industries Ltd (now Israel Weapon Industries Ltd) of Ramat HaSharon. The Galil’s design is optimized for operation in arid conditions and is based on the Finnish RK 62, which itself was derived from the Soviet AK-47 assault rifle. It was selected as the winner of a competition for the Israel Defense Forces that included many other rival designs (among them, the M16A1, Stoner 63, AK-47 and HK33) and was formally accepted into service in 1972, replacing the dust-sensitive FN FAL. The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56x45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 ball cartridge and several models designed for use with the 7.62x51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after the Galilee (Galil in Hebrew), a large region in northern Israel. There are four basic configurations of the Galil: the standard rifle-length AR (Assault Rifle), a carbine variant known as the SAR (Short Assault Rifle), a compact MAR (Micro Assault Rifle) version, and an ARM (Assault Rifle and Machine gun) light machine gun. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

The Galil’s design is optimized for operation in arid conditions and is based on the Finnish RK 62, which itself was derived from the Soviet AK-47 assault rifle. It was selected as the winner of a competition for the Israel Defense Forces that included many other rival designs (among them, the M16A1, Stoner 63, AK-47 and HK33) and was formally accepted into service in 1972, replacing the dust-sensitive FN FAL. The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56x45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 ball cartridge and several models designed for use with the 7.62x51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after the Galilee (Galil in Hebrew), a large region in northern Israel.

		<German>The AG36 grenade launcher has been developed by the famous German company Heckler + Koch as a replacement for its previous add-on 40mm grenade launcher, the HK79. The initial platform (host rifle) for AG36 was the  HK G36 assault rifle, which is now in service with German and Spanish armies. Later on, the AG36 has been adopted to British  L85A2 assault rifle, and to  Diemaco C7A1 assault rifle, which is in service with Dutch army. The latest version of the AG36 is the AG-C/EGLM (Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module), a modification which can be mounted on the  M16A4 assault rifles and  M4 carbines using Picatinny type rails under the forend. A version of the AG-C grenade launcher, known as XM320, is now considered by the US Army as a possible replacement to the venerable  M203 underbarrel launcher under the OICW Block 1 program. If it will be adopted, it then would receive the M320 designation. A special kit is available to convert AG36 into a stand-alone weapon. This kit includes a detachable shoulder stock. AG36 is a single shot, break open weapon. The barrel opens by unlocking and swinging its breach to the left. This allows the operator to use projectiles of any length, including extra-long less-lethal 'baton' and tear gas warheads. The trigger of AG36 is of double-action only type, and it is provided with ambidextrous manual safety. Standard sight is of ladder type, with electronic rangefinding sight being developed for future precision applications. AG36 can fire all standard types of 40x46mm 'low velocity' grenades. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>

Standard sight is of ladder type, with electronic rangefinding sight being developed for future precision applications. AG36 can fire all standard types of 40x46mm 'low velocity' grenades. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</Polish>
		<Hungarian>The AG36 grenade launcher has been developed by the famous German company Heckler + Koch as a replacement for its previous add-on 40mm grenade launcher, the HK79. The initial platform (host rifle) for AG36 was the  HK G36 assault rifle, which is now in service with German and Spanish armies. Later on, the AG36 has been adopted to British  L85A2 assault rifle, and to  Diemaco C7A1 assault rifle, which is in service with Dutch army. The latest version of the AG36 is the AG-C/EGLM (Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module), a modification which can be mounted on the  M16A4 assault rifles and  M4 carbines using Picatinny type rails under the forend. A version of the AG-C grenade launcher, known as XM320, is now considered by the US Army as a possible replacement to the venerable  M203 underbarrel launcher under the OICW Block 1 program. If it will be adopted, it then would receive the M320 designation. A special kit is available to convert AG36 into a stand-alone weapon. This kit includes a detachable shoulder stock. AG36 is a single shot, break open weapon. The barrel opens by unlocking and swinging its breach to the left. This allows the operator to use projectiles of any length, including extra-long less-lethal 'baton' and tear gas warheads. The trigger of AG36 is of double-action only type, and it is provided with ambidextrous manual safety. Standard sight is of ladder type, with electronic rangefinding sight being developed for future precision applications. AG36 can fire all standard types of 40x46mm 'low velocity' grenades. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</Hungarian>

		<German>The MG4 is a belt-fed 5.56 mm light machine gun designed and developed by the German company Heckler + Koch. The weapon was developed in the late 1990s and was first seen publicly in September 2001. It has been selected to replace the 7.62 mm MG3 general purpose machine gun in the Bundeswehr at the squad support level; it will complement the MG3 in other roles. The MG4 will also be the secondary armament of the new Puma  infantry fighting vehicle. Overall, it is designed to be light, provide maximum safety to the user and function reliably under adverse conditions using a wide range of ammunition from different manufacturers, without the need to adjust the gas system.

		<German>The Carl-Gustav series recoilless rifles/launchers are single shot, breech loading weapons with rifled barrels. Unitary ammunition of 84mm caliber is loaded into aluminum cases with open bottoms, closed by plastic pressure discs. The primers are located at the side of the cartridge case, so the round must be properly aligned in the bore upon the loading. To achieve that, the case rim has a special indexing recess. Most types of projectiles are just warheads which are "blown out" of the barrel by the propellant charge, but some most recently developed types of ammunition has built-in rocket boosters, which are ignited as the round reaches safe distance from the shooter, greatly improving the maximum effective range. The rear part of the barrel is fitted with venturi nozzle, which is hinged to allow loading of the ammunition and ejection of the fired cases or unfired rounds. The M2 (m/48) barrels are made from steel, and the M3 (m/86) barrels are made from thin steel liners enclosed into polymer wrapping, so the M3 launcher is significantly lighter. The firing unit consists of the pistol grip with the trigger and manual safety, which is linked to the ignition module at the rear of the weapon by the tube, located below and to the right of the barrel. Under the barrel, there's also a shoulder rest, an adjustable bipod, and a front support grip. The Carl-Gustav recoilless rifles / launchers are fitted with folding open sights, located at the left side of the barrel, but usually issued with telescope sight of 2X or 3X magnification, which has range-finding reticule and can be adjusted for temperature and wing conditions. &lt;br/&gt;From world.guns.ru</German>
