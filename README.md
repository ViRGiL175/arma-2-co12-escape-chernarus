# Escape Chernarus mission for Arma 2

Do you remember those good old Escape mission? Do you want stressful action-full coop military experience? Do you bored by flat and inexpressive Arma 3 warfare process?

Then this mission is for you!

### What is this?

In this mission you must escape from captivity in the midst of hostilities in Chernarus: get out of the guarded area, deal with the search parties and not die on the battlefield, get the map, equipment, organize an attack on the enemy communications center, contact your allies and proceed to the declared evacuation point.

##### This is an assembly of several projects.

The [original logic and mission was created by Engima](https://web.archive.org/web/20210302085542/https://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=16162). On this basis there were two mods: a [mod from HulaZone team](https://web.archive.org/web/20210123151358/https://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=20862) with a bunch of new content (weapons, vehicles, enemy classes) and a [mod from Iceman](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225022305/https://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=21728), which added to the map an active and very expressive military clash.

We liked both, so we decided to combine these two mods to make an escape with lots of content, and in a live dynamic combat environment where anything can go wrong and deeper.

### Why Arma 2? Is it still exists?

Yes, Arma 2 has fewer features, buggy as hell, morally and technically obsolete, but...

Gosh, how cool the explosions look and sound in it, how juicy helicopter and plane crashes, artillery fire (and sometimes shotgun) destroys buildings and almost every UAZ has a total ear destruction weapon on the roof!

It's all about expression. And Arma 3 doesn't have that kind of expression even close, it's like high-tech paintball.

We tried the same Escape mission in Arma 3, but time after time we came back to Arma 2 for the fun, the bugs, and the intense experience.

### How can I play it?

In the [Releases section](https://github.com/ViRGiL175/arma-2-co12-escape-chernarus/releases) you can download the latest version of the mission. To install and run it, you need to:

1. Install Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead or Combined Operations
2. Get some way to connect your whole team directly; for example, [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/)
3. Download all the folders from the releases section and copy them to your Arma 2 folder
4. Go into the game, in the multiplayer section, create a server, select our mission and go

### How can I help you make it greater?

GitHub has Issues and Discussions sections where **you can write about bugs, your adventures, ideas, and other stuff**. We're very interested!

If **you know anything about Arma modding**, any help is welcome (because this is our first project, and we haven't even played Arma itself, only Escape and DayzMod)!

Feel free to create your own builds and send them to us, if you know how to use GitHub, we are waiting for your Pull Requests. We will review, test and make Escape better and better!

If **you have any interesting mods from Arma 2** (Armaholic and other resources are already dead in time), that could improve Escape, don't hesitate to share them with us!

Because even mods from HulaZone and Iceman were saved on our computers only by a true miracle and could be lost forever.

Thank you! **Enjoy!**
